# French Research Revolution – Hackathon Dauphine (4th Place)

This repository contains the project we developed during **Hackathon Dauphine**, a blockchain-based platform designed to improve collaboration between **patients, researchers, and hospitals** in clinical studies.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Secure medical record submission via a web application (PHP + SQL).
- AI-driven medical data extraction (concept prototype).
- Blockchain layer for anonymization and certification of sensitive data.
- Incentive mechanism: patients rewarded for contributing anonymized health records.
