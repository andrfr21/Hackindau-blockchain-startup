# French Research Revolution – Hackathon Dauphine (4th Place)

This repository contains the project we developed during **Hackathon Dauphine**, a blockchain-based platform designed to improve collaboration between **patients, researchers, and hospitals** in clinical studies.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Secure medical record submission via a web application (PHP + SQL).
- AI-driven medical data extraction (concept prototype).
- Blockchain layer for anonymization and certification of sensitive data.
- Incentive mechanism: patients rewarded for contributing anonymized health records.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `webapp/` → PHP web application code
- `database/` → SQL schema and initialization script
- `docs/` → pitch deck & hackathon report

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Import `database/data.sql` into MySQL.
2. Configure connection in `webapp/config.php`.
3. Launch the web app locally (Apache/Nginx + PHP).

## 👥 Team
