# Hackindau-blockchain-startup
This repository contains the project developed during Hackathon Dauphine, where our team achieved 4th place. The goal was to design a blockchain-based project in a weekend and we developped a blockchain-based platform to improve collaboration between patients, researchers, and healthcare providers in clinical studies.
